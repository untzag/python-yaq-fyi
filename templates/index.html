<p>
The <a href="https://yaq.fyi">yaq project</a> defines a modular and extensible instrument control framework.
Within this framework, each component of an instrument is driven by a daemon.
These daemons then speak with one or more client applications to control the instrument.
</p>

<p>
This subdomain is dedicated to clients and daemons implemented using <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>.
Python is an expressive and dynamic language that allows for very rapid development.
Many yaq daemons and clients are implemented using Python, and Python is an excellent choice for those wishing to develop new daemons or clients to add to the yaq ecosystem.
Because each daemon and client are separate applications, Python implementations may communicate seamlessly with implementations in any other language.
